- 👋 Hi, I’m @EtEsWieEtEs from Cologne, Germany, living in its south near by the "seven mountains".
- 👀 I’m developing in c/c++ , shell scripts and python to program among other things my hardware microcontroller projects
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a PLC based on Teensy 4.0/4.1 , 
      which substitute the original circuit boards of a Moeller PLC PS4-341/141, 
      because of defects after 25 years operating in my house fuse boxes.
      It's a bit hard, because of no debugging possibility of the teensy 4.0, but it takes on hardware side what I need
